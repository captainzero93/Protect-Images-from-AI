## Introduction
AI scraping involves the automated collection of images from the internet for training AI models. This practice can lead to unauthorized use of personal or copyrighted images. PixelGuard AI aims to protect your images from such scraping by applying various invisible techniques that interfere with AI processing while preserving the visual quality for human viewers.

## System Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Customization
The GUI allows users to adjust the strength of each protection technique. Use the sliders to fine-tune the balance between protection effectiveness and image quality.

## Updating
To update PixelGuard AI to the latest version:
1. Pull the latest changes from the repository:
   ```
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. Reinstall requirements in case of any changes:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter "ModuleNotFoundError", ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
- For image format errors, check that your image is in one of the supported formats.
- If protection seems too strong or weak, adjust the settings using the GUI sliders.

## Limitations
While PixelGuard AI significantly increases protection against AI scraping, it may not be 100% effective against all current and future AI technologies. It's designed to strike a balance between protection and maintaining image quality.
